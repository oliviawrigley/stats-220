# stats-220 - Olivia Wrigley

## Why create this repo?
* Even though creating a repo is essential and a requirment for the assignment
* This is a great platform and way of collating my work 
* Tracking my progress through out the 220 course and my futrue in github

**In this repo I will be displaying all the work I have created so far Stats 220.**

*In part A of this assignment, I was tasked with creating an original meme and using GitHub.*

* The Meme I created for Assigment 1 (link to my meme here: [Meme](https://github.com/oliviawrigley/stats-220/blob/main/my_meme.png))
* My index file which I used with both Markdown and R to showcase my meme and give detail about it (Link to work here: [Index](https://github.com/oliviawrigley/stats-220/blob/main/index.md)) ðŸ’»
